# Summary
Project for HawkHacks 2024!
This is a Godot project made in GDScript that we made in less than 48 hours as part of the Wilfred Laurier Hackathon.
We built a game where the goal is to manage your own garden.

# Features
- Intuitive point-and-click interface
- Ability to plant four different types of flowers: daisies, lilies, sunflowers, and tulips
- Basic simulation of four different growth stages (seedling, bud, flower, wilted flower)
- Ability to dig up flowers at any point
